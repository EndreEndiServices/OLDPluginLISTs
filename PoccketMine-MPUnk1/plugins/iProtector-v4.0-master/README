iProtector is a PocketMine-MP plugin that allows you to create areas to protect your spawn and warps from being griefed by your players. This version implements new features to enjoy more @LDX-MCPE's plugin.

What's new:
- You can enable and disable the plugin from the config.
- You can choose whether enable or disable the area pretty saving feature.
- You can use a new flag! TNT. Protects against TNT and Creeper explosions.
- You can use a new command! /area here. It allows you to see what area you are standing on.
- You can set custom messages for each event, and also disable the ones you want; place; break; touch and hurt.

Installation:
For current iProtector users, you must delete the PHAR file of the plugins/ folder (it is not going to delete the areas, they are stored in the iProtector/ folder) and follow the same steps:

To install this plugin on your server, be sure to follow these steps:

[!] Since the releases zone does not guarantee the up-to-date plugin updates, and many of them may not be compatible with your server software due to the API version, use the download method for developers.

1. Download the repository (using the Download button or cloning it with git clone).
2. Visit pmt.mcpe.fun, on the upper left side open the menu and tap on "Create phar".
3. Tap the clip icon next to "No zip file choosen..." and upload the previously downloaded ZIP file.
4. Tap the "Create phar" button.
5. After the PHAR file has been created, it should automatically download on your browser.
6. Upload the PHAR to the plugins/ folder on your server.
7. Restart the server. You're ready!

Be sure to make monthly updates of the plugin by removing the PHAR file of the plugins/ folder and repeating the previous steps to stay up to date with the new features and bug fixes.
