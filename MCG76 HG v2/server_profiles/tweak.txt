how to fix lags in minecraft?

1. assign minecraft (php) process higher priority
2. store world in fast hard-disk like SSD.
   or store them in RAM disk if you have lots of memory
   
4. install additional network card


things I've ruled out as problems:

Router
Wireless/wired makes no difference (small but has been tested both ways)
