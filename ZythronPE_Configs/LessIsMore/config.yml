LessIsMore:
  # number of lines per page
  lines per page: 5

# Below this line, you can freely add or remove anything to create, delete or modify commands!

# You can create a simple command with a single line of response like this:
less: &aLess is more!

# You can create a simple command with 5 lines per page like this:
# the first line is the command name without the "/"
rules:
# Add lines to this
- Rule 1
- Rule 2
- Rule 3
- Rule 4
- Rule 5
- Rule 6. This rule will automatically go to the next page, because only the first 5 lines will be on page 1.
- Rule 7
- Rule 8

# You may want to add description and/or aliases to this command:
description:
  description: What do you think a description command's description would be?
  aliases:
  - desc
  - descr
  # and then you add the usual lines under "lines", but with two spaces in front
  lines:
  - The /description command actually does nothing!
  - This isn't surprising, right?
  - But please forgive me, because it's hard for a developer to think of demo examples!

# If you want to specify a different lines-per-page in a command, you can do it like this:
info:
  lines per page: 3
  lines:
  - This server uses LessIsMore.
  - And LessIsMore is a very simple plugin!
  - Although it is simple, you can do many interesting things with it!
  - This line will be on the second page, because lines per page for this /info command is 3!

# Or if you want to change to a page break at the lines called "==PAGE BREAK=="
more:
  # You can actually set this to anything you like!
  page break: ==PAGE BREAK==
  lines:
  - &eDo you believe that less is more?
  - If you don't believe, type "/more 2"!
  - If you believe, type "/more 3"!
  - ==PAGE BREAK==
  - You typed "/more 2" because you wanted to know more about what this command tells you.
  - But this LessIsMore plugin actually makes this page display less.
  - But if we revealed everything on page 1, you won't read it, so you will read less!
  - And now you are reading more!
  - ==PAGE BREAK==
  - &aThanks for believing! As a reward, I now send you a useless message!
