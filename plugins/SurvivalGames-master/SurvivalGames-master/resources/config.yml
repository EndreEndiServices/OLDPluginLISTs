#     SurvivalGames to suit your needs. It is recommended you edit this file with a text                 #
#     editor such as Notepad++. If you mess up this file beyond repair, just delete it                   #
#     and it will be re-created with the default settings when the server restarts.                      #

# It should be written like this

# maps:
#   - city
#   - spaceship
#   - underworld
#
maps: []

# Set to false to leave chests in their original state instead of randomizing them.
