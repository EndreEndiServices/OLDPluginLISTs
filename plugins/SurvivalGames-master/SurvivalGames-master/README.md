SurvivalGames
=============

A minigame plugin mainly developed by [DinoKill](https://github.com/DinoKill).

Player's first go into the lobby where they wait for other players and vote for a map to be used for the game.

Once the game begins, the players will then spawn around chests each containing useful items.

Using the resources you have, you can fight with other people within the arena.

If you are killed you have the option of ethier leaving or spectating the game.

When the amount of alive players gets low enough or enough time passes, deathmatch will commence!

During deathmatch you are restricted to being in spawn only. Trying to escape could lose you precious health!

The winner is the last one standing. If you happen to have an economy plugin you might be rewarded money.

While most of the gameplay comes from the original map, we'll try to add as many exclusive features as possible.
