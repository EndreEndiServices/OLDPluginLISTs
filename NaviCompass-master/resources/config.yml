VERSION: "2.0.2" # Internal use only

# Choose your transfer type:
# "external" will use an IP address and port to move players between SERVERS
# "internal" will use your preset command string to move players between WORLDS
# "hybrid" will include both transfer types
Transfer-Type: "hybrid"

# This is the command string that will be used to transfer players between WORLDS
# Don't worry about this if you're only using the EXTERNAL transfer type
# Use '{player}' for the player's name
# Use '{world}' for the world name
World-CMD: "multiworld tp {world} {player}"

# This is where you choose if world command should be run by the player or the console
# Don't worry about this if you're only using the EXTERNAL transfer type
# Options are: "console" and "player"
World-CMD-Mode: "console"

Selector:
  # Choose whether the selector item should be enabled
  Enabled: true

  # Choose what item the server selector should be
  # Default item is Compass (345)
  Item: 345

  # Choose what slot of the player's inventory the selector should appear in
  # The range for this input is 0-35 (0-8 are the player's hotbar)
  Slot: 0

  # This is the text that will show on the selector in the player's inventory
  Name: "§l§aServer Selector"

UI:
  # This is the title of the transfer UI
  Title: "§9Server List"

  # This is the message that will show under your title on the transfer UI
  Message: "§aChoose a server to transfer to!"

  # This is the message displayed under each SERVER button
  # Don't worry about this if you're only using the INTERNAL transfer type
  # Use '{current-players}' for the server's current player count
  # Use '{max-players}' for the server's max player count
  # Use '{status}' to show whether the server is online or offline ('Online' will show as green; 'Offline' will show as red)
  Server-Button-Subtext: "§r{status} §8(§a{current-players}§8/§b{max-players}§8)"

  # This is the message displayed under each WORLD button
  # Don't worry about this if you're only using the EXTERNAL transfer type
  # Use '{current-players}' for the world's current player count
  World-Button-Subtext: "§r§o§8Tap to Teleport §8(§a{current-players} §eplayer(s)§8)"

# This is where you list your servers or worlds to be displayed on the transfer UI
# You can use '§' and '&' on the labels to style your servers or worlds inside the UI
# For images, use 'url' or 'path' to show an image in the menus (or leave blank to disable)
# NOTE: If you are using a URL, do NOT include the 'https://' or 'http://' in the link!
# If you don't want to use an image, simply don't add anything after ServerPort/WorldAlias in the listing
# If you are using the INTERNAL transfer type, the world alias will be used in the transfer command
# You must also be sure that the world alias is EXACTLY the same as the world's folder name

# Add as many servers or worlds as you'd like:
# Add SERVERS using this format → ext:ServerTitle:ServerIP:ServerPort:ImageType:Path/URL
# Add WORLDS using this format → int:WorldTitle:WorldAlias:ImageType:Path/URL
